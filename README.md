# Mental Health and Crime in Chicago

The Cook County Jail, which serves as the primary pretrial detention facility for arrestees in Chicago, is also one of the largest psychiatric treatment centers in the U.S. Starting in 2019, the City of Chicago released a new Framework for Mental Health Equity, investing millions of dollars each year to improve access to treatment.

We are exploring the relationships between access to mental health treatment, crime, and dispositions of criminal cases involving mandatory mental health treatment in the City of Chicago, with a particular emphasis on these relationships on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis.

We have already obtained data on crime and mental health in Chicago through apis from the city (data.cityofchicago.org), the Chicago Health Atlas (chicagohealthatlas.org) and Cook County (datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov).  We are in the process of importing the data into a SQL database and designing map visualizations with geopandas.

One particular area of interest is Cook County's small, but highly effective "problem solving courts" for mental health and drug rehabilitation. We are examining the criminal offenses, locations, and demographics of individuals referred to these programs in relation to case outcomes, and attempting to model potential outcomes if these programs are expanded.
